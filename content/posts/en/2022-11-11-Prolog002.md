As their name suggests, calling conventions define common rules for passing arguments and return values to and from a function. Well, you might say... but the difficulty is that there are several of these conventions. For example, they are different between LINUX 64-bit and WINDOWS 64-bit, and again different between Linux 32-bit and Linux 64-bit...

Since there are many, we will limit ourselves to calling conventions on Intel X86 processors (32-bit and 64-bit). Generally, I leave aside on my blog everything that concerns ARM processors, and therefore do not write about considerations for MAC M1 built on ARM64.

Before talking about OS (LINUX and WINDOWS 64-bit), let's study 3 of the main calling conventions encountered in **32-bit** Intel architectures:
- `cdecl`
- `stdcall`
- `fastcall`

### `CDECL`

This calling convention is widely used by C compilers on the X86 **32-bit** platform.
In the `cdecl` convention, the responsibility of cleaning the stack **falls to the calling procedure** (I refer you to the previous post to grasp the essential notions of Stack, caller, callee). As a reminder, "cleaning the stack" means that the caller must reposition the ESP register (stack pointer) to the address it had before the call (before its call).

The main (non-exhaustive list) properties of this calling convention are:

- arguments are passed to functions via the stack
- return values from functions are returned by the **EAX register** for integers
- return values from functions are returned by the **x87 ST0 register** for floating-point numbers
- the EAX, ECX, and EDX registers must be saved by the caller
- all other registers must be saved (if necessary) by the callee

```asm
push a3
push a2
push a1
call addition
add esp,12        ; and there you go, I put the stack pointer back where it was before the call
```

### `STDCALL`

This convention is used for function calls in the **Win32 API**..

The main (non-exhaustive list) properties of this calling convention are:

- This time, it is the **called function** that is responsible for cleaning the stack
- arguments are passed from right to left
- return values from functions are returned by the **EAX register** for integers and addresses
- return values from functions are returned by the **DX, BX, AX registers** for floating-point numbers
- the EAX, ECX, and EDX registers must be saved by the caller
- all other registers must be saved (if necessary) by the callee

```asm
push a3
push a2
push a1
call addition
```

```asm
addition:
; ....
ret 12      ; and there you go, I put the stack pointer back where it was before the call
```

### `Microsoft FASTCALL`

The main (non-exhaustive list) properties of this calling convention are:

- uses the ECX and EDX registers to pass the first 2 arguments (from left to right) to the called function. Then uses the stack to pass the following arguments (but this time from right to left)
- it is the **called function** that is responsible for cleaning the stack

Note, on a 64-bit OS, compilers will ignore (without raising an error) the `__fastcall` directive. Indeed, these compilers must produce code that respects the OS's ABI. And for 64-bit conventions, it's just below...

Let's now move into the wonderful world of **64-bit OS**, a world that mainly breaks down into 2 calling conventions:
- Linux 64-bit (_System V AMD64 ABI_)
- Windows 64-bit (_fastcall_)

### Windows 64-bit

This convention is used in Windows x86-64 DLLs (instead of `stdcall` in win32). It is quite similar to a `fastcall` convention.

1. The first 4 arguments are passed in the RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 registers, the following arguments are passed on the stack.

2. The caller must also prepare space on the stack for 32 bytes, or 4 words of 64 bits, where the callee can save the first 4 arguments. This allocated memory space is called `the shadow space`.

3. The callee is responsible for restoring the stack pointer to the value it had before the function call.

4. The RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, R11 registers are considered **volatile**, meaning their saving is the caller's responsibility.

5. The RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, RSP, R12, R13, R14, R15 registers are considered **non-volatile**.

### Linux 64-bit (and MacOS ;-)

This convention is defined in the **SYSTEM V AMD 64 ABI** and is used by many UNIX, LINUX, and MacOS systems.
It is, in the end, quite similar to the Windows 64-bit convention, here are the main principles:

1. The **first 6** arguments are passed in the RDI, RSI, RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 registers, the following arguments are passed on the stack.

2. No creation of `shadow space`.

3. The callee is responsible for restoring the stack pointer to the value it had before the function call.

4. The RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, R11 registers are considered **volatile**, meaning their saving is the caller's responsibility.

5. The RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, RSP, R12, R13, R14, R15 registers are considered **non-volatile**.

And that's the essential knowledge about calling conventions and ABIs.

**To summarize, if you have followed the series of 3 PROLOG posts (Asm, Memory, and this one), then you are able to put all these pieces together.
And for that, there's nothing better than a little exploitation of a simple Buffer Stack Overflow (BOF for insiders ;-). Well, that's the exercise I propose to you in [the next post to conclude this PROLOG series and then move on to serious things]({{< relref "2022-10-6-Prolog003" >}}) ...**
